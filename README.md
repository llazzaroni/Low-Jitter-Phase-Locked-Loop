# Low-Jitter Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Design

## Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a low-jitter Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) suitable for integration. The design features a double-sampling PLL topology that minimizes jitter while maintaining high performance, and it was implemented in 5 nm FinFET CMOS technology. The PLL operates at a frequency of 16 GHz with a reference frequency of 100 MHz, achieving 1-2 ps jitter and 1.88 mW power consumption.
